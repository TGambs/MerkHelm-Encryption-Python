# MerkHelm-Encryption-Python
This project was created as part of my coursework for the Network Security (F21CN) module in 4th Year at Heriot Watt.
It utilizes Merkle-Hellman block encryption and gives the user the following commands to input:
```
f  = full key generation with a preset 500 characters plus encryption and decryption
c  = choose text to encrypt and decrypt with generated keys
d  = decrypt ciphertext using given values
g  = just generate public and private keys
q  = Exit program

$ *choose option here*
```
